Exercise F:
  1. Building both private network and local area network  are relatively cheap, 
     whereas creating a wide networks involves much more effort and resources
     1/1
 
  2. The communication link of the Ethernet are ordinary coaxial cable 
     connected to every node via T-connector. Therefore the Ethernet is the 
     one of the most popular network based on bus topology. 1/1

  3. 10GBASE-T standard enable data transmission with 10Gb/s speed, using 
     shielded or unshielded twisted pair. Moreover signal is sent on 
     distance up to 100 meters. 0.5/1

  4. By and large, the mesh network is type of network, in which every node 
      are connected with one node at least. 1/1

  5. When the DHCP protocol is not use, to the computer a static IP address 
      are assigned. 0.5/1

Exercise G:
  For small company, the most suitable topology can be a star topology, because
  we can achieve a reliable connections with a little bit of effort. First of 
  all,  in new generation of star topology, which use the Ethernet, we use 
  switches instead of hubs, therefore the Ethernet becomes more efficient. 
  Moreover we don't need an aditional hardware to us nodes, because every 
  computer are equiped with Ethernet adapter. Even though prices of copper 
  unshielded twisted pairs are much bigger then fibre optics, as i said before 
  we don't need a suplementary devices, like a fiber optics network adapters or 
  media converters.
