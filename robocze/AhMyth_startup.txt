sudo apt-get install nodejs openjdk-8-jdk npm
git clone https://AhMyth/AhMyth-Android-RAT
cd AhMyth-Android-RAT/AhMyth_Server

npm install electron@nightly

Also make sure you have openjdk 8 selected if have more than one version of openjdk installed, you can do this by typing
sudo update-alternatives --config java

Then type "2" and press enter for the option of openjdk-8, if it is not already selected

Also turn Bridged Adapters on in your virtualbox Network settings, switch it from NAT to Bridged Adapter

Hopefully this helps
